# AsymmetricEncryption

The beginnings of an implementation for Asymmetric Encryption. Essentially an attemp to recreate RSA using knowledge gleaned from the internet (and much smaller scales than actual RSA). Result will hopefully be relatively secure for sending messages between users, but obviously not on the same level as real RSA encryption.
